\chapter*{Acknowledgements} % Acknowledgements section text

I'd like to thank David Abrahamson for suggesting this project to me and for his hard work keeping me working towards the finishing line despite my occasionally unannounced absences from our meetings.

I should also thank Glenn Strong for his willingness to answer my questions about the finer points of Haskell and for some excellent suggestions when I was stuck in the wrong train of thought.

I would not have been able to do complete this project without the support of my mother, who has always done everything in her power to help me. Thank you.

Finally, Ana, without whom I might never have returned to study Computer Science at all, and certainly would not be who I am today.
